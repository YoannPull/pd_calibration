- Review the pipeline code : We review the data creation, we are now working on the imputer. The imputer work in the data_vis.ipynb but we should be able to put it into .py files. The goal is to save the imputer to be able to update the new data comming with NA. (What about new NA that we never see ?)
- We should also from the pipeline code obtain the same bin creation and the initial credit segmentatation (we should save this information also)


- Train the pipeline on a longer TTC-PD time series.
- Implement a rolling-window backtest: for each quarterly forecast, generate a table matching the format used in our articleâ€”this will provide the inputs needed for the Jeffreys calibration test
