# For version control we should comit the poetry.lock

poetry init -> initialise a poetry environment
poetry_env activate -> show the env path
eval $(poetry env activate) -> activate directly the environment
poetry add numpy -> add numpy into the pyproject.toml
poetry update -> update all the package to their last version 

When adding a package we can specify the exact version that we want (see https://python-poetry.org/docs/dependency-specification/)
An example of that is :
poetry add "django@^4.0.0"
